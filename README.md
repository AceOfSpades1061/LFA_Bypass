## The Skiddy Chromebook Exploiting Dictionary, 1st edition:
KV / Kernel Version:
A security component in ChromeOS that prevents downgrading the system to older versions using recovery media. Google uses kernel version checks to block installation of outdated or vulnerable ChromeOS builds.

Major Version:
The first three numbers of a ChromeOS version string (for example, 120.0.6099). This identifies the primary release cycle of the operating system.

RMA Shim:
An RMA Shim is a special ChromeOS image used by technicians and authorized repair centers. Because Chromebooks are heavily locked down, the shim provides an environment for running custom diagnostic, repair, and testing tools. By letting custom scripts run, RMA Shims can be modified to be used for unenrollment (Like Sh1mmer).

## Checking Version:
Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc and look at the top for your codename (yavilla), and it should display your major version to the right of your codename (example: yavilla, version 140.16371.0). <img> src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AceOfSpades1061/SCPS_Bypass/refs/heads/main/images/slightlystupid.png" alt="the students at my school being skiddy as always" width="100"</img>
