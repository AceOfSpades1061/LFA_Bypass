## Kernel Version
The anti-downgrader google implemented to, y'know, stop you from downgrading to vulnerable ChromeOS Versions.

### Versions you can downgrade to with your kernver:
- Kernver 0: Any
- Kernver 1: Any
- Kernver 2: v111
- Kernver 3: v120
- Kernver 4: v125
- Kernver 5: v132
- Kernver 6: v138
- Kernber 7: v143

## Checking Version:
Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc and look at the top for your codename, and it should display your major version to the right of your codename (example: yavilla, version 140.16371.0). <img> src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AceOfSpades1061/SCPS_Bypass/refs/heads/main/images/slightlystupid.png" alt="the students at my school being skiddy as always" width="100"</img>
